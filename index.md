## whoami

I got into tech by learning system administration and setting up servers.

Then got interest into programming by tinkering my linux machine and learning about the kernel and low-level programming.

I started the Epitech computer science school and learned to tackle technical concepts and applying them quickly by working on small projects.

My goal is to use my knowledge and experience to make software helping its users accomplish their needs.

When I feel like it, I write on my [blog](https://blog.x4m3.rocks) and upload [videos](https://youtube.com/philippeloctaux).

Almost always working while listening to music.

I also like to play Counter-Strike or Rocket League when I have some free time.

I speak English, French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· and Russian ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º.
