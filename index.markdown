## whoami

Passionate about tech since my childhood and later in programming, I started to tinker with system administration by setting up servers, then learned the basics of web programming, got interested in security, low-level programming and how operating systems work.

Sometimes when I feel like it, I write on my [blog](https://blog.x4m3.rocks) and upload [videos](https://youtube.com/philippeloctaux).

I'm also a big fan of [techno music](https://soundcloud.com/ploct4ux/likes).

### timelapse

I created and maintain a timelapse of a virtual canvas where people place colored pixels to make art.

### vim plugins

I use vim as my text editor of choice, so I learned vimscript and wrote plugins to make my life easier.

### talks

Giving small talks helps me reduce my fear of public speaking, and I get to share what I know.
